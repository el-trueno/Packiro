# Open todos

## Clean-up

- Remove $tc from list column labels

## Shopware does not support stackable or removable child line items

1. Contribute missing stuff to Shopware and hope they will release it
2. Do not work with bundles (sorting and cross-assigment should be buggy)
3. Let it be (old configurator did not have this features at all)

## UX

- Admin: Better selection for accessory options

## Data

- Add tags to options
